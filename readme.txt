A plugin that enables you to handle movie collections on your WordPress.

== Description ==

**WordPress Movie Library** is a plugin that enables you to manage and share your movie collection: movies you enjoy since you were kid, movies you just saw in theater an hour ago, movies you've owned in DVD for years. All this on your WordPress blog.

The plugin is a fork of th0th's Movie Collection plugin on version 1.0. Th0th did an awesome job with his plugin and saved me a lot of work by furnishing a nice working base for what I had in mind. The plugin fetches movie information from TheMovieDB.org using the REST API. You can write your review of movie just as you are writing a blog post and you are ready to go!

**WordPress Movie Library** offers you three ways to share your movies:

* A custom post type page (you can display your movies just like your regular blog posts)
* Widgets (you can use two types of widgets. newest movies widget for movies that you added recently and best movies for movies with the highest rating)
* Shortcodes (you can show your movies in a post or in a page)
