WordPress Movie Library
=======================

__WPMovieLibrary__ is a WordPress Plugin to turn your WordPress Blog into a Movie Library. Share your favorite or latest seen movies, manage collections of genres, actors or crew, fetch overviews, casts and posters in a single clic, show the world your love for movies. WPMovieLibrary uses TheMovieDB API (see http://themoviedb.org) to fetch metadata about your movies: director, genres, actors, producer, country, languages… You can also import images and posters directly to your blog to illustrate your library.

__WPMovieLibrary is still in development!__ We're working on the plugin every day or very close so, and even though the very first stable version is really close now and most of the essential features are available you may experience errors and bugs here and there when trying to use the plugin at a production level. Any feedback is welcome, feel free to open issues at will to ask for new features or report bugs!
